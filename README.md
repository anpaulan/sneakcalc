## PREFACE

This project is an idea I have and would like to turn into a coding project rather than maintained in Microsoft Excel (XLS). My ideal state would be to use Application Programming Interfaced (APIs). I would also like to implement data scrubbing/scanning so that many of the manual inputs are automated and this just WORKS. Though this is a lofty idea, this is project I will start working on. I have the basis as I have already built it into an XLS format. But this will be used for resellers, but can be adjusted to tailor to anyone who sells product. 

## INTRODUCTION:
- Welcome to my reselling application, this wil help you keep track of your inventory as well as your financials
- If you are a reseller, and want an easy way to keep track of your business, this is the tool for you 

## DESCRIPTION
- This is an easy way track your inventory, sales and expenses
- You will be able to see this breakdown by month, and export your data to be used for your taxes
- The idea is to minimize the number inputs you will need for this program to function, so you can save time book/inventory keeping, and spend more time securing pairs of sneakers

## SETUP
- The only setup needed is inputting your inventory into the database
- Occasionally, when selling platforms (StockX, GOAT, Stadium Goods, eBay) update their fee structure, the easiest way to adjust is by manually adjusting the fee figures
